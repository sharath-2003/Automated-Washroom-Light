# Automated-Washroom-Light
Project on Automated Washroom light using Ultrasonic Sensors

∗ A user friendly automated washroom light system has been developed using Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04 as the input
device, Arduino UNO microcontroller, and a 2-channel relay module for controlling the output supply.

∗ It’s been programmed on Arduino IDE,such that switches on when sensor detects the user in the range 30-70cm and
switches off in the range below 30cm ,the light will automatically turns off if no has been detected as set by the user.

∗ This project mainly focuses on the energy saving, reducing wet hand touch on electrical devices and premium experience
for the consumer.
